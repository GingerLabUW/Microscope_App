PI Python Libraries
===================

PIPython is a collection of Python modules to access a PI device and process
GCS data. It can be used with Python 2.7+ and 3.4+ on Windows, Linux and OS X
and over a socket also on any other platform.

controller name as argument::

    from pipython import GCSDevice
    gcs = GCSDevice('C-884')
    gcs.InterfaceSetupDlg()
    print gcs.qIDN()
    gcs.CloseConnection()
